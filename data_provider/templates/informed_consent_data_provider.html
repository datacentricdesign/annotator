    Are you the one we are looking for?
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    By taking on this task, you will participate in a scientific study in the context of sleep behaviour led by the TU
    Delft researcher Di Yan, under the supervision of Dr Jacky Bourgeois and Prof. Gerd Kortuem, members of the 'research team'. Your participation is
    voluntary, and you can withdraw at any time. To complete this task, we expect:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      You are an active Apple health user who collected sleep data <b>in the past weeks</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        You use <b>a wearable device</b>(e.g., Apple watch, Garmin watch) to collect sleep data, which help you get an <b>green barchart in different shades</b> according to your sleep pattern.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Notice that <b>you won't be able to complete this survey and get commission</b> if you do not meet these requirements. </p>

      What task will you perform?
  </h2>
  
  <p>You will be invited to complete the following tasks:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Open your Apple Health App, capture and upload a screenshot of your sleep data over the past weeks.
    </li>
    <li>
      Reflect on the uploaded screenshot and answer questions to elaborate on your sleep experiences in text format.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The whole task will take you approximately <b>25 minutes</b> to complete.</p>
  
  
  <h2>
    How do we protect your data?
  </h2>
  
  <p>We protect your data in the following ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        We designed this task to collect anonymous information using your Prolific ID as unique reference.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        We provide detailed instructions to take appropriate screenshots, and exclude your personal information. <b>Please follow the instructions carefully.</b>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        At the reception of your data, we will scan through it to remove any remaining identifyable information (e.g. bluring part of a screenshot, removing part of your textual contribution).
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        We will share the annonymised version of your screenshot with crowd-workers for interpretation and reflection tasks. All other information will be accessible only by the research team.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        We will store all data on a password-protected, encrypted server hosted by the TU Delft.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
